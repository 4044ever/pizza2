You need an easy cookies policy? Here is one...

A clean and simple implementation from [github > idarek/cookies-bar](https://github.com/idarek/cookies-bar/blob/main/cookie.html)


The file locations are:  
`/layout/partials/cookie.html`  
`/static/js/cookie.js`  
`/static/css/style.css`

I use that cookie bar, but not the `style.css`, I prefer [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) type of CSS.
