<h1>This is not a baking site</h1>

No, this is not a baking site. Yes, I bake things, but this site is more about webdesign with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a static site generator. 

So mostly I use this site for testing things, different designs, different codes etc. It makes it convenient to put some recipes I use online. 

Certain things, like pizza and baguettes, I like to scale. When you have a pre-ferment or sourdough the calculations become a bit annoying. And specially for baguettes and pizza sometimes I want smaller, or bigger - hence a recipe where you input what you want and have the numbers ready is very helpful to me. And hopefully to some others too.

Enjoy it and let me know if you like it.
